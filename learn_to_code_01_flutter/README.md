## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources you could need:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

Android Studio plugins we used:
- Flutter
- Dart

For help getting started with Flutter, view Flutter's [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This project uses Flutter version 2.0.2 - Channel Stable, therefore if you plan to use latest Null Safety Flutter version you will have to adapt your code to Null Safety.
